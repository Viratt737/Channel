Not many people did at the turn of the 20th century. But that didn’t stop him beginning what has become a long history of outdoor cinema exhibition in Australia.Sun Pictures in Broome opened with Jack Hulcup’s 1913 silent film Kissing Cup, in which a “squire’s jockey” escapes kidnappers and gallops across the Isle of Wight in time to win the race.

        description: "Questioning traditions and conventions was part of the postmodern order of the 1980s and 1990s. Some social scientists were questioning whether universal laws characterize human functioning and development, and whether development is context-free or value-free. It was increasingly recognized that human behavior and development are situated in particular action settings, in particular times, and in particular cultures. Within the context of these trends, developmentalists were seriously embracing the view that culture is essential to human behavior and development. Doing so was further bolstered during this time through increasing access to Vygotsky’s ideas about culture and development that resulted from new translations of his work and contact between Western and Russian scholars."
