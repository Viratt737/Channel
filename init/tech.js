        description: "NASA's Parker Solar Probe made its closest-ever approach to the Sun on Tuesday, becoming the first man-made object to accomplish this feat. Parker should have travelled as close as 6.1 million kilometres to the Sun, gathering important data about its outer atmosphere. The confirmation about these feats should arrive by December 27, as the space agency had to disconnect from the craft during the passage. During this flyby, the spacecraft is said to have reached a speed of 6,92,000kmph, establishing itself as the fastest object created by humanity."
