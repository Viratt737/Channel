        description: "The travel trend to China has gained major momentum, largely driven by the country's expanding visa-free policy. From crowded streets in Shanghai to tourists flocking to Chongqing, the surge in foreign visitors has made 'China travel' a global phenomenon. As per Qunar, a major Chinese online travel agency, the number of foreign travellers booking domestic flights has nearly tripled compared to 2023, with top travellers from the US, Russia, Canada, South Korea, and Australia.The most notable change is the extension of visa-free stays to five inland provinces—Shanxi, Anhui, Jiangxi, Guizhou, and Hainan—giving tourists more regions to explore. Other provinces like Fujian, Hubei, and Shaanxi also see extended stay areas, allowing tourists to access more parts of the country."
